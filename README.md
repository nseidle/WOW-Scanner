Grocery Scanner
=======

Grocery scanner is an interactive exhibit at the [WOW kid's museum](http://www.wowchildrensmuseum.org/) in Lafayette, CO. Sliding a plastic fruit, empty box, or even your hand causes the scanner to turn on a bright red LED and beep with that satisfying grocery store checkout beep.

This exhibit was created by Chris Francis and has been maintained by Nathan Seidle. It is a tremendously popular exhibit. Kids really enjoy being able to do what their parents do at the store.

The scanner is flush mounted to a low height checkout counter for small kids. The electronics are placed in a metal box with a clear acrylic cover. The cover in this picture has had 4 years of significant wear and tear but the IR distance sensor continues to function without problems.

This exhibit is rock solid and had been running for multiple years without maintenance.
